# beatcode

My study of some of the coolest stuff in computer science, algorithms and data structures, across multiple languages.

Also working my way through the neetcode roadmap:

Concepts to Cover

- linkedlist (reverse, kth from end, cycle detection trick, mergesort),
- dfs (paint fill, phone number letter combinations),
- backtracking (comb sum without duplicates),
- bfs (level order traversal for shortest path, knight moves),
- dp (top down + bottom up, longest increasing subsequence, coin change problems, knapsack),
- binary search (first and last position in sorted, bin search on fn arguments ie capacity to ship within D days)
- string stuff (palindrome after removing invalid chars),
- array stuff (missing/duplicate numbers, move zeros, rotate, 3sum, path sum, max product subarray)
- interval problems (merging, meeting room trickery)
- stack stuff (matching parens, calculator, monotonic increasing stack, backspace string compare)
- matrix stuff (rotate, sudoko junk, search, number of islands)
- tree stuff (min height, diameter of tree, longest univalue path)
- BST stuff (preorder, postorder, inorder traversal, inorder successor, all vals k distance from target)
- trie data structure
- sliding window (anagram of one string in another)
- topological sort (course prereqs)
- harder graph stuff (connected components: union find and dfs, cheapest flights k stops)
- heap stuff (merge k sorted lists, k most frequent, interval problems)
- lru cache
- babys first mathy stuff (sieve of eratowhatever, reversing digits, convert to base whatever, add strings)
