# Two Pointer Technique

- important part of the dev toolkit, there are a lot of problems that compare elements, by checking two at a time we can speed things up
- a pointer in this case is a reference to an object, that object stores a memory address of another value located in memory
- The tortoise and hare (floyds) cycle finding algo is an example of this teechnique

How it works
- two pointers, starting from beginning and end until both meet
- one pointer moves slower than other (half speed)
