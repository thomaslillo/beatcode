# Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

Each node usually has a value, a pointer to the next node, and usually a pointer to the previous node (making it doubly linked).

There are multiple types including singly linked and doubly linked lists, which are referenced above, but there are also circular linked lists - where all the nodes form a circle - and header linked lists where you can use a header node to store information other that the information found in each node of the linked list.
